# MigraPreterv1.0
I developed the MigraPreter tool to migrate to a process running on a Windows machine. This tool uses meterpreter / reverse_tcp payload to create an EXE file according to the selected architecture by entering the IP address and port number of the machine that started the listening mode with the metasploit tool. When this file is run, the meterpreter session will be obtained through any process running on the Windows machine.
